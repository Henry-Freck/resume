# Description

This has a class file (resume.cls) and a tex file (HenryFreck_Resume.tex). The class file defines the template formatting directives and the tex file has your resumes content.

To render this into a PDF, you can use any LaTeX conversion utility. I would recommend using VSCode with the LaTeX Workshop extension: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop
